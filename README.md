# REZE

A sleek **React + Vite** web app built by Aditya.EXE — simple, high-performance, and ready to deploy.

## 🚀 Demo

## 🔍 What Is REZE?

REZE is a modern front-end application that uses React for UI and Vite for fast bundling and hot-module replacement.
It's designed to be lightweight, blazing-fast, and developer‑friendly—ideal for building scalable, responsive web apps.

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack

* **React** — for the component-based UI
* **Vite** — for rapid dev builds and optimized production builds
* **JavaScript / HTML / CSS** — vanilla web stack at its best
* **Vercel** — recommended for deployment (because, you know, it’s smooth)

---

## 💡 Features

Here are some (potential) key features — adjust as needed:

* Hot Module Replacement (HMR) during development
* Optimized production build via Vite
* Clean project structure (src folder, component‑based)
* ESLint setup (I saw an `eslint.config.js`)
* Zero-config deployment workflow with Vercel

---

## ✅ Getting Started

These instructions will help you run REZE locally and deploy it.

### Prerequisites

* Node.js (version X.Y.Z or higher)
* npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone this repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aadityaexe/REZE.git
   ```

2. Go into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd REZE
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

### Running Locally

To start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Then open your browser at `http://localhost:5173` (or whatever Vite tells you).

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```

The production-ready files will be in the `dist/` folder (or the output directory configured in `vite.config.js`).

---

## 📦 Deployment

* **Vercel**: This project is super compatible with Vercel. Just connect your GitHub repo, and Vercel will detect the build command (`vite build`) and output directory (e.g. `dist/`).
* If you use another platform (Netlify, etc.), make sure your build settings match.

## 🤝 Contributing

1. Fork this repository
2. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature`
3. Make your changes and commit them: `git commit -m "Add some feature"`
4. Push to your branch: `git push origin feature/your-feature`
5. Open a Pull Request — I’ll review, nitpick, and (hopefully) merge 😈

---

## ❗ Known Issues / Limitations

* *No backend* — REZE is strictly a front-end app unless you plug in an API
* *Environment variables* — currently not configured (or document as needed)
* *No SSR / routing setup* — if you need server-side rendering or complex routing, that’s future territory

---

## 💬 Getting Help

If you run into any trouble or want to suggest improvements:

* Open a GitHub Issue
* DM me (well, metaphorically — via GitHub)
* Or just scream into the void (I'll try to hear you)
